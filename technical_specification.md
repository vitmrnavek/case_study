Great choices! Let's refine the implementation plan based on your selections and ideas:

### 1. **Database Connectivity**

- **Packages for Postgres and BigQuery**:
  - **Postgres**: Use `psycopg2` or `SQLAlchemy` for connecting to Postgres.
  - **BigQuery**: Use `google-cloud-bigquery` for connecting to BigQuery.

- **Secrets Management**:
  - Use **Google Cloud Secret Manager** to securely store and access database credentials. This will help in managing secrets without hardcoding them in your codebase.

### 2. **Class Design for Database Operations**

- **Prototype Class**:
  - Create a base class `Database` with common methods for connecting, constructing queries, and fetching data.
  - Implement subclasses `PostgresDatabase` and `BigQueryDatabase` that inherit from `Database` and override methods as needed for specific database operations.

- **Class Structure**:
  ```python
  class Database:
      def __init__(self, connection_params):
          self.connection_params = connection_params

      def connect(self):
          pass

      def construct_query(self, params):
          pass

      def fetch_data(self, query):
          pass

  class PostgresDatabase(Database):
      def connect(self):
          # Implement Postgres-specific connection logic

  class BigQueryDatabase(Database):
      def connect(self):
          # Implement BigQuery-specific connection logic
  ```

### 3. **Data Joining and Handling Duplicates**

- **Join Logic**:
  - Implement a function to perform joins using Pandas, allowing users to specify the type of join (left, right, inner, outer).
  - matching should be based on col, not function, to enforce good practice (ability to match with equality or range only on numerical values)
  - Provide options for handling duplicate columns, such as:
    - Keeping columns from one table only.
    - Merging columns based on a defined logic (e.g., prioritizing non-null values).

- **Join Function Example**:
  ```python
  def join_data(df1, df2, join_type='inner', handle_duplicates='keep_first'):
      if handle_duplicates == 'merge':
          # Implement logic to merge duplicate columns
      elif handle_duplicates == 'keep_first':
          # Drop duplicate columns from the second dataframe
      return df1.merge(df2, how=join_type)
  ```

### 4. **Testing and Validation**

- **Testing Script**:
  - Develop a script to test the database classes and join logic with various complex queries.
  - the test should check check if cols are the same type and if they % of match
  - Validate the correctness of joins and ensure the handling of duplicate columns works as expected.

### 5. **Metadata Generation**

- **LLM Integration**:
  - Use an LLM to generate metadata for the resulting table. This can be done by sending context information (table names, columns) to the LLM and retrieving descriptive metadata.
- llm could produce the parameters from human input and run the matching itself

### 6. **Logging and Analytics**

- **Log Queries**:
  - Implement logging to capture query execution times and other relevant metrics.
  - Use these logs to analyze performance and optimize query execution.

### 7. **Code Structure and Output**

- **Object-Oriented Design**:
  - Structure the code using the designed classes to encapsulate database connections, query execution, and data joining.
  - Ensure the code is well-documented with comments explaining the functionality.

- **Script or Notebook**:
  - Provide the final implementation as a Python script or Jupyter notebook, ensuring it is easy to test and modify.


- **Edge Cases**:
  - the best would be to run validations before queries into database, but sometimes its not possible to do so, bcs we cannot 




### 8. workflow
1. user adds one of available connections
1a. if connection is not available, error
2. connection is checked
2a. if any problem, error
3. schema of available tables and columns is gathered in connection object
3a. for each table metadata statistics is gathered (table schema, rows count, size, description of table and content) and saved in data
4. user then can have multiple steps to do
4a. manual work
4aa. search in available tables - get_table
4ab. test queries - fetch_data
4ac. create join by him - join_data
4b. ai - write a prompt
4ba. prompt about data - "i need this what would you suggest"?
4bb. suggest case creation of parameters - "create me a join based on following case"

objects
- connection parameter details
-- possibly enhance with secret manager?
- connection objects
-- fetch_data - will produce logs in google cloud logging
-- available schema
-- schema metadata storage
- will check if metadata are the same, first on general, then look for specific tables where changes were made
- ai agent
-- prompts for metadata creation
-- ask_about_data
-- suggest_join
- join_data
